# Analysis of grouped genome differences

Given a set of genomes with a certain character, determine their closest relatives, identify a set of genomic features (enzymes, protein domains, and enzyme alignments), and then apply a random forest model to sort the genomic features by importance in the classification problem. This yields lists of genomic features that are associated with the character of interest.
